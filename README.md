# HRBDataset
This Dataset is used for all kinds of detection of height restriction bars.  

This Dataset is collected with **Smarter Eye Technology Co., Ltd.**  

This dataset contains all kinds of data of HRB. They are collected from cities in China. It includes:   

left images and right images of HRBs, depth data, which are captured by stereo camera.

labels for object detection (yolo form)  

labels for sematic segmentation (citycapes form)  

Parameters for images, cameras and targets.  

We also create virtual dataset of HRBs by Blender, we used it as a complement to the real dataset.
